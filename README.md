# Disclaimer
As most of the course content belongs to either the College or the Professors, I am transcribing my work and assignments to record the course.

As such, many assignments and files **may not include detailed descriptions or solutions**. This is done to avoid violations, avoid doxing myself and others, and any number of other reasons. If for any reason the full repo must be accessed, all assignments, descriptions, solutions, and class files are stored in a private version of the repo (so contact me. If you're a current student, don't bother since I won't give you access and it wouldn't help you anyway xp).

If possible, portions of the class will be linked to a separate readme explaining more about the linked assignment/solution/description/other.

If there exist any honorcode violations or any problems/solutions are *too* in-depth, please contact me. The intention of each public class repo is to record my experience and assignments of each class taken.
