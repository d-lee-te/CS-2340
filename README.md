# CS 2340 - Objects and Design (Fall 2021)
I took CS 2340 @ Gatech in the Fall of 2021.

Lectured by Dr. Aibek Musaev.

This class revolved around design methodology and notation, and a final project/game implemented w/ version control in Git over the semester.

The final project was a Tower Defense Game written in Java and used the JavaFX library and JUnit for testing.

### Course Curriculum
- (Movement - Synthesis) Improve existing programming skills by developing much larger and more complex programs than in previous classes.
- (Accomplishment - Synthesis) Given a requirements list, complete a four-person large-scale programming project that implements those requirements. The project will require at least 5000 lines of code and multiple compilation modules (or equivalent jars) to complete.
- (Experience - Analysis) Reflect on the difficulties of team membership and the challenges of developing software in a team environment.
- (Competency - Application) Demonstrate the ability to use a version control system such as Git to manage team code.
- (Competency - Application) Demonstrate the ability to use standard tools to help with large-scale projects such as automated build scripts (such as Ant, Maven, or Gradle), automated code checking (PMD, Checkstyle, FindBugs), and commercial quality development environments (such as Eclipse or IntelliJ).
- (Movement - Synthesis) Improve object-oriented development skills by learning to think in objects when faced with a design problem. This is evidenced by minimal use of class methods and data and proper use of abstraction, information hiding, and encapsulation.
- (Competency - Synthesis) Given a specification of requirements, analyze those requirements using domain models, use cases, and robustness diagrams. Select appropriate candidate objects representing the problem domain.
- (Competency - Synthesis) Given a set of use cases and domain models representing a customer problem, design an object-oriented solution and document that solution using the Unified Modeling Language (UML).
- (Competency - Analysis) Apply standard design principles and patterns to a problem specification. Analyze a proposed design to determine its compliance with the standard principles (like open-closed, dependency inversion, Law of Demeter) and make corrections as necessary.
- (Competency - Application) Analyze a user interface to determine its usability using one of three standard techniques: Heuristic Evaluation, Cognitive Walkthrough or Think Aloud.  Document your findings in a written report.
- (Achievement - Synthesis) Given a problem specification, design, document, and implement an object-oriented solution as a development team.
- (Competency - Analysis) Demonstrate the ability to derive whitebox and blackbox tests from code or specifications. Document those tests in a basic test plan and implement those tests using an automated test environment such as JUnit.

### Milestones
1. Team formation - Meet team members, establish availability, draft team contract, create repo, configure .gitignore, add readme file
2. Diagrams and Models - Use case diagram, domain model, create empty game environment, create welcome screen, create game screen, write unit tests
3. Towers - User story, sequence diagrams, created tower menu, implement placeable towers, create 3 tower types, write unit tests
4. Enemies - Robustness diagram, create enemies, create game over screen, write unit tests
5. Combat - Design class diagram, implement combat w/ health, damage, and damage types, add tower shooting animation, implement economy/money system, write unit tests
6. Finality - SOLID and GRASP principle demonstration documentation, implement upgrade system, add final boss, create win game screen, write unit tests, record and demonstrate game
### Debrief

In hindsight, I feel mixed about this class.

From what I remember, this class still required us to use the JavaFX library. Our team didn't enjoy using Java to build this game. Adding the JavaFX library and the JUnits testing framework, I believe, only made it harder for our team to enjoy building out the game. 
Thankfully, from what I understand, they loosened up these requirements in following years.

With the above criticism in mind, it is not to say I didn't enjoy the project itself. This was my first exposure to version control using git, and I spent some time trying to understand how to use git and its version control system. My teammates at the time helped guide me through it. Speaking of, this repo is somewhat awkward. 

As much as I would like to fork the actual project repository from a few years ago, not only does it exist on the gatech github, but I also don't think I'd be able to put any of the content in this repo or present it publically in any way anyway. I'd love to credit my teammates at the time who worked on it, but I've had some trouble finding their usernames. If I do end up finding them, I will credit them and add to this readme in the future.

# Disclaimer
As most of the course content belongs to either the College or the Professors, I am transcribing my work and assignments to record the course.

As such, many assignments and files **may not include detailed descriptions or solutions**. This is done to avoid violations, avoid doxing myself and others, and any number of other reasons. If for any reason the full repo must be accessed, all assignments, descriptions, solutions, and class files are stored in a private version of the repo (so contact me. If you're a current student, don't bother since I won't give you access and it wouldn't help you anyway xp).

If possible, portions of the class will be linked to a separate readme explaining more about the linked assignment/solution/description/other.

If there exist any honorcode violations or any problems/solutions are *too* in-depth, please contact me. The intention of each public class repo is to record my experience and assignments of each class taken.
